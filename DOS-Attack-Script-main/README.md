# DOS-Attack-Script
This is an basic script that you can use to do a Denial-of-service attack.
You can spoof Your ip adress and you can send packets using different ip adress too.

To Use The script You need to have Python3 pre installed On your computer.
I would recommend You using linux or mav os for this.

To Run the Script:
